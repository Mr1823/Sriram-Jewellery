/**
 * Help Center — FAQ plus routes to a human.
 *
 * The contact form was previously the only support surface, which forces a
 * customer to wait for a reply to a question we could have answered on the
 * page. Answers below are limited to what is verifiably true of this system
 * today (how pricing works, how sign-in works, what we store). Anything that
 * depends on business policy links to the relevant policy page instead of
 * asserting a second, possibly contradictory, version of it here.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Why does the price of a piece change between visits?",
    a: "Gold and silver pieces are priced live. We calculate metal value from the piece's weight and the current rate, add wastage and GST, and show the result. As the metal rate moves, so does the price. The figure that binds your order is the one calculated when you place it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does “Price on Request” mean?",
    a: "Some pieces — typically diamond and bespoke work — are quoted individually rather than computed from a metal rate. Send a quote request and we'll come back to you with a price for that specific piece.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I sign in? I don't have a password.",
    a: "You don't need one. Enter your mobile number and we send a six-digit code to it. That code signs you in and, if it's your first visit, creates your account at the same time.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm not receiving my code.",
    a: "Check the number you entered, including that it's the one you have with you. Codes expire after five minutes, so request a fresh one rather than using an older message. If it still doesn't arrive, contact us and we'll help you order directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "I was signed out unexpectedly.",
    a: "Sessions expire after a period of inactivity, and signing in again restores everything — your cart and wishlist are saved to your account, not to the device. You can stay signed in on several devices at once, so browsing on your phone won't sign you out on a laptop.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store my card details?",
    a: "No. Card numbers, CVV and UPI PINs are entered inside Razorpay's checkout and never reach our servers. We only receive confirmation that a payment succeeded. See our Security policy for detail.",
    link: { to: "/legal/security-policy", label: "Read our Security policy" },
  },
  {
    q: "My payment failed but money left my account.",
    a: "Banks sometimes authorise an amount before a payment fails. The hold is released automatically, usually within 5–7 working days. If it hasn't returned by then, contact us with your order reference.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I return or exchange a piece?",
    a: "Return windows, conditions and how refunds are calculated against a live metal rate are set out in our Return & Exchange policy.",
    link: { to: "/legal/return-policy", label: "Read the Return & Exchange policy" },
  },
  {
    q: "Where is my order?",
    a: "Order status is under My Orders in your account. You'll find the current stage of each order and its reference number there.",
    link: { to: "/dashboard/myOrders", label: "Go to My Orders" },
