 * Shown once, immediately after a new customer sets their name.

 * It explains the one thing about this shop that genuinely surprises people:
 * prices move with the metal rate. A customer who doesn't know that reads a
 * changed price as a bait-and-switch. That is the whole justification for the
 * screen — it is not a product tour, and it is skippable.
 *
 * Reached with state: { from } — the page they were heading to before signing
 * in, so onboarding never costs them their place.
